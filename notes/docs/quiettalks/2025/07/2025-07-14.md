## 3 things worth it

 本周的重点在于'项目关联'功能，经过测试的测试，发现自己之前的完成的并不是那么"完美"...，一开始还觉得“蛮好的”。   
 后来才发现还是有一些场景没有照顾的到哈哈哈，开发相对来说，反而是过程中比较简单的一步，需求到代码实现的方案设计，是更为关键一步。当然这一步也需要一些时间，如果工期紧的话，可能大家都是直接开发，边开发变改了吧... 

> I had made a new friend who studies fine arts. z Comes to QD, and on the first Day. I want  to  treat z to a meal. But z insisted on having instant noodles. Since we didn't have hot water, we went to KFC to ask for some. I took the opportunity and said, "let us just eat here, and i will treat you a McFlurry." It was still quite early after eating, so we continued wandering around the area and chatted a bit about philosophy...
