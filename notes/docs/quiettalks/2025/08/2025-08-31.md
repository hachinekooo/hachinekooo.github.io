## 3 things worth it

 - I've been trying to analyze, design, and develop a complete open-sourxe project that can solve real-word problems and be truly paractcal.
 - I am still learning English, and i have found a great, low-precessure method for it.
 - This weekend, I went into the kitchen and cooked a dish of shredded potatoes(土豆丝). It turned out quite presentable(有模有样) this -- at the very least, it was still shredded potatoes, not a potato pancake(土豆饼)!
 - I met up with friend.
 - I also added a small life insight:
	 - Take a deep breath and let your mind calm down little by little.Listen to the sounds around you and look at the smiles in front of you.
	 - Just fell it -- fell those tiny, warm sounds(细碎的、温热的声响). Pause for a moment-pause in the present(驻足在此刻的时光). You might not realize how incredibly precious everything you are experiencing right now is.
