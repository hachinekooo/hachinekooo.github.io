For example: 'okay , i dont like you, but we still have to work together.'</h2>\\n<h2>What I probably desire most is to be influential, which might stem from childhood experiences of insecurity and feeling invisible.</h2>\\n<h2>It’s okay to have a healthy sense of self-worth—to feel stronger or more perceptive than others sometimes. But we should avoid polarized thinking, and instead say something more neutral, like “we just focus on different things.”</h2>\\n<p>My anxiety might be rooted in deeper childhood experiences.
